# Kick-3D
Commodore 64 3D engine

I have made a small C64 program to see if I can make a 3D engine, just for fun. And I have never had an intention to build the full game engine. 
But, since I already have something that is, I believe, usable, I would like for somebody to use it.

Project is written in the C64Studio software (https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/C64_Studio).

## Open the project
Start the C64Studio, select `File > Open > Solution or project...`
Browse until you find the kick3d.s64 file and open it.

## Build and run
Select the kick3d.asm tab in the C64Studio and then from the menu select `Build > Bulind and Run`

If you have VICE emulator set up to run by the C64Studio, program will compile and run in the emulator.
