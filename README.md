Commodore 64 3D engine

I have made a small C64 program to see if I can make a 3D engine, just for fun. And I have never had an intention to build the full game engine. 
But, since I already have something that is, I believe, usable, I would like for somebody to use it.

Project is written in the C64Studio software (https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/C64_Studio).
